# Problem Solving
This file will explain more about the app and answer some questions you might have

## Who is my Audience?
I'm building this app for those struggling to pick the best choice for a startup founder. This can also apply to anyone else. Just that the content I'll be reffering to often help CEOs/founders make decisions daily. 

## How will I solve this Problem?
Theres a concpet where you can put all of your goals/tasks/decisions into 4 squares. Kinda like a SWOT analysis. It's called the Eisenhower Matrix. This decision making tool will show you whats a priority and what isn't. After you find out what actually is a priority, then you can time block.
